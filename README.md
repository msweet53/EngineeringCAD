The base was easy to make. It was a great start to learing the software

The mount was also easy to make. Very similar to the base.

The fork was were things started ot get different, Onshape is a much easier and easier to use software.

The tire was a good step in learing how to use revolves in onshape.

The wheel was another good step in learning how to use revolves in Onshape.

The axle and caps were relatively easy to make. Another great step in learning the software.

The subassembly was very easy to make. Onshape makes assemblies incredibly easy.

The final assembly wasn't hard at all. Assemblies are super easy in Onshape.

Dorothy's dowel pins:
Configurations were fun an surprisingly easy. For the full frame I misttok the assignment for being less constrictive than it actually was and I just made my own frame that did not folow the constraints or instructions, my bad. I did not use multiple lengths for my dowel pins but I do know how to change the configuration when you insert a part (I am assuming that is why that was in the assignemnt). I was having some trouble with my full assembly and mating but I think that it was just being a little buggy and/or I have bad internet lol. But other than that I feel very confidnt with configurations in Onshape. 
Suggestion for future assignments:
Maybe in the future make the final product a little more fluid in terms of constraints.
